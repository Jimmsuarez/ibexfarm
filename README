Run script/ibexfarm_server.pl to test the application.

You should set the environment variable STATIC=1 so that the test
server will serve static files.

To run in debug mode, set the environment variable CATALYST_DEBUG=1.

You need to create a configuration file 'ibexfarm.yml'. An example is
given in 'test_ibexfarm.yml'. You can get a complete list of config
variables by running 'findconfigvars.pl'.
